# Introduction to Machine Learning Projects

## About
These are 5 small projects I created as part of the assignments in the course Introduction to Machine Learning.
Exercises 1, 2 and 3 are programmed in pure Python & Numpy, without any use of designated ML libraries (such as PyTorch).

### Exercise 1 - implementing K-Means Algorithm
In this project I wrote a small program implementing the K-Means algorithm.

---

### Exercise 2 - Implementing 4 Different Classifying Algorithms
This program is the implementation of KNN, Perceptron, SVM and Passive Aggressive.
Each is a multi-class classifier between 3 classes. All of their hyper-parameters were calibrated.

---

### Exercise 3
In this program I implemented my first neural-network without any designated Python library. This network is generic and
adjustable (you may change the number of hidden layers and their sizes). Moreover, it supports 3 different activation
functions: Sigmoid, ReLU and Tanh. The last layer is consisted of the Softmax function that provide probable classification for 10 classes.
This network is built for the MNIST dataset. All the hyper-parameters were calibrated.

### Exercise 4
This program makes use of the Pytorch library. It's an implementation of a neural-network that classifies the Fashion MNIST
dataset. All the hyper-parameters were calibrated.

---

### Exercise 5
This program makes use of Pytorch as well, this time creating a CNN (VGG-11). It is used for classifying the Google-Command
dataset. Also, it is CUDA for the heavy calculations - if available.

### Running The Code Yourself
    The code is pretty easy to follow and does not require special installations, except for PyTorch for 4 & 5.

    With that being said, some of the datasets are too big and cannot be uploaded here. Datasets such as MNIST & Fashion MNIST
    and be found online. Further more, in the programs with PyTorch, the dataset can easily be downloaded online by changing the right command.
